    <p>
      This page is meant for developers, publishers and ebook
      enthusiasts who are interested in the adoption of the
      ePub standard.
    </p>

    <h2>About ePub</h2>
    <p>
      ePub is the open format of the The International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).
      It is based on XML and XHTML, re-using existing standards for 
      digital books.
    </p>
    <p>
      The technical details and specification are available from <a href="http://openebook.org/">http://openebook.org/</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>How Bookworm implements ePub</h2>
    <p>
      Because ePub's content format is XHTML, ePub and the web browser
      are a natural fit.  If you use Bookworm, you take
      advantage of more than 10 years of browser technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allows Bookworm to support advanced layout and markup
      that standalone reading software cannot, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tables</li>
      <li>Lists</li>
      <li>Fixed-width fonts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ePub details</h2>
    <h3>The Table of Contents</h3>
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/expanded-nav.png" alt="Expanded navigation" class="bw-screenshot-page" align="right" />
    <p>The Table of Contents may not just contain chapters.  It might
      also include parts, books, or sub-chapters.  
    </p>

    <ul>

      </li>
      <li>Bookworm supports illustrations and photos in all the 
      formats that ePub does: <em>JPEG</em>, <em>GIF</em>,
      <em>PNG</em>, and even Scalable Vector Graphics (<em>SVG</em>), if
       you are using a browser which supports SVG.
      </li>
    </ul>
