<p id="bw-about-description">
  Bookworm's full-text search allows you to find words across
  all of your ePubs. You can search in multiple languages,
  and use advanced phrase searching and boolean operators similar to
  those supported by Google.
</p>

<h3>Bookworm uses Xapian</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://xapian.org/">Xapian</a> is a free, open-source search
  engine which supports many of the features available in products 
  costing hundreds of thousands of dollars: fast indexing and retrieval,
  stemming, spelling correction and synonym support.  (At this time
  Bookworm exposes only a fraction of those features, but more will
  be added with time.)
</p>

<h3>Phrase searching</h3>
<p>
  Like Google, if you want to restrict your search to only a particular
  phrase ("White House" vs. ePubs that include both the words "white" and
  "house"), then enclose them in quotation marks.
</p>

<h3>Boolean operators</h3>
<p>
  Like Google, the default boolean operator is AND, meaning that in a 
  multi-word search, all of the words must appear (but not necessarily
  right next to each other).  You can change this behavior by
  including boolean terms in your search:
  <ul>
    <li> <em>white AND house</em> &mdash; Same as search for <em>white house</em>.</li>
    <li> <em>white OR house</em> &mdash; Find ePubs with either word</li>
    <li> <em>white NEAR house</em> &mdash; Find these two words near each other (within 10 words)</li>
    <li> <em>white NOT house</em> &mdash; This is a good way to find ePubs that <em>don't</em> contain the phrase "White House" but do contain the word "white"</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Ordering</h3>
<p>
  At this time, results can only be returned in relevance order.  Relevance 
  means how likely it is that a give result is what you were looking for.
  The algorithms used to determine relevance are complex and their results
  aren't always as intuitive as those in a massive commercial search engine like Google.
  (Xapian uses the <a href="http://xapian.org/docs/bm25.html">BM25 weighting
  scheme</a>). 
</p>
<p>Simply put, ePubs with more occurrences of your search terms will appear
higher in the results. Remember that stemming can influence the number of 
terms matched in a way that might be unexpected.</p>

<h3>Stemming</h3>
<p>
  By default, Bookworm searches for words assuming that they are in English.
  It will automatically search for other parts of speech for that word,
  so a search for 'run' will also match 'runs', 'running', etc.  You can
  change your default language to apply different spelling rules;
  see <a href="{% url search_language %}">language support in Bookworm</a> for 
  more on this subject.
</p>
<h3>More information</h3>
<p>
  Complete documentation for Xapian can be found on the Xapian site.  The <a href="http://xapian.org/features.php">feature list</a>
  is a good high-level introduction.
